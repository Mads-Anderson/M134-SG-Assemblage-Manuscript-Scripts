# Anderson et al. M134 SG Assemblage Mansucript Scripts

This repository contains analysis scripts used for the manuscript "The Abundance, Diversity, and Assemblage Structure of the Macrobenthos at the South Georgia Shelf Methane Seeps". 

1. **01_Diversity_Indices** This script calculates several ecological diversity indices (Shannon, Inverse Simpson, Species Richness, and Pielou's Evenness) for methane seep communities in South Georgia. The results are then saved into a new Excel file, "Diversity_Indices.xlsx". Table 4 in Anderson et al. manuscript.

2. **02_Abundance_Plots** This script processes and visualizes species abundance data from methane seep communities at varying depths (0-2 cm and 2-5 cm) in South Georgia. It calculates relative and absolute abundance for different taxa, and then generates stacked bar plots for both depths, which are combined into a single figure for comparison. Figure 5 in Anderson et al. manuscript. 

3. **03_Abun_Multivariate** This script analyses species abundance data from methane seep sites using multivariate statistical techniques to identify key species and ecological patterns. Figure 6A in Anderson et al. manuscript.

4. **04_Env_Abun_Multivariate** This script processes abundance and environmental data from methane seep sites in South Georgia, performs an NMDS, and visualises the results with environmental variables. Figure 6B in Anderson et al. manuscript.

5. **05_SO_Comparison.rmd** This script contains code for data manipulation, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), and visualizations of Southern Ocean samples. It generates two key plots: one showing NMDS with species richness across stations, and another depicting NMDS with carbon type at each station. Figure 7 in Anderson et al. manuscript.

7. **06_Poly_Comparison** This script processes ecological data using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) to explore the relationship between sites and species based on Polychaete abundance data across the Southern Ocean. Supplementary Materials 6 in Anderson et al. manuscript.
